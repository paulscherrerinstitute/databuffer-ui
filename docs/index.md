# Databuffer UI online manual

This is the online documentation for _databuffer UI_ version 4.

## How-To guides

These guides provide step-by-step instructions for **achieving common tasks**. We try to keep them short and to the point, so you can reach your goal without much fuss. That's why in the how-to guides we keep explanations to a minimum. We want you to have a little bit of context and maybe a pointer or two if you _want_ to extend your knowledge, so you don't have to trust us blindly.

## Reference material

The reference material provides **detailed information** where appropriate. These are not ressources for learning, but for looking up, i.e. you'll find _what_ is there, and _where_ can you find it, but _not_ what you might want to use it for.
