This is the online manual for _databuffer UI_ version 4.

<p style="font-size:150%;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;">⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠️</p>

Please note, that this manual, just like version 4 of _databuffer UI_ itself, is still a work in progress.

You'll find lots of places where the manual is yet incomplete, or only holds placeholder content.

For your orientation the manual is broken down into these parts:

- [Tutorials](./tutorials/index.md) provide step-by-step instructions to **learn your first steps**. We strive for an intuitive and easy to use graphical user interface, and hence sincerely hope nobody _needs_ the tutorials. But maybe you'd _like_ to have the option.

- [How-To guides](./howtos/index.md) provide step-by-step instructions for **achieving common tasks**. We try to keep them short and to the point, so you can reach your goal without much fuss. That's why in the how-to guides we keep explanations to a minimum. We want you to have a little bit of context and maybe a pointer or two if you _want_ to extend your knowledge, so you don't have to trust us blindly.

- [Topic guides](./topics/index.md) provide background information to **deepen your understanding** of a certain aspect. Here we can discuss certain topics in depth and also have a look at alternatives and such.

- [Reference material](./reference/index.md) provides **detailed information** where appropriate. Here you'll find _what_ is there, and _where_ can you find it, but _not_ what you might want to use it for.
